                    <p>Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair 
                        between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the 
                        dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds 
                        as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure 
                        the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and 
                        richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, 
                        the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic 
                        imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and 
                        country life and all the variations on love 
                        and family happiness.</p>

                        For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate 
                        its contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary 
                        was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks 
                        us today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young 
                        woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is 
                        its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence 
                        of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of 
                        Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor 
                        figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.

                        leading up to Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and the impact of 
                        the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, as seen through the eyes 
                        of five Russian aristocratic families.
